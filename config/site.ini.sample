# The canonical domain name for your instance.
# This is used in a number of places:
# - Requests coming to other domain names will be redirected to the canonical one.
# - Message IDs for new messages will use this setting for the hostname part.
# - External URLs to web resources (e.g. in IRC announcements) will use this setting for the host part.
# Default is "localhost".
