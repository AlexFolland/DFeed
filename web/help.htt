<h2 id="view-modes">View modes</h2>

<p>
  You can browse the discussions using one of several view modes:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Basic</b> - A forum-like view with paged linear threads.</li>
    <li><b>Threaded</b> - Threaded group overview with single post display, similar to mailing list archives.</li>
    <li><b>Horizontal-split</b> - JavaScript-powered interface with a split view and keyboard shortcuts, similar to a mail or newsgroup client.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="read-post-history">Read post history</h2>

<p>
  The posts you've viewed are saved to a compressed cookie, or on the server if you're logged in.
  Viewing a thread in basic view will mark all displayed posts as "read".
  The horizontal-split view allows marking individual posts as "unread".
</p>
<p>
  To avoid losing read post history, consider registering an account to avoid cookie limitations / expiration / accidental deletion.
</p>

<h2 id="accounts">Accounts</h2>

<p>
  Preferences and read post history are stored in cookies for unregistered users.
  Registering an account will transfer all variables from cookies to the server database.
</p>

<h2 id="email">Email address</h2>

<p>
  When posting, you need to indicate an email address.
  It doesn't need to be a valid one; this software will not send anything to the specified address.
  The email address will be made public to other users of the news server / mailing list you are posting to.
  Therefore, please be aware that malicious robots may be able to collect your address and send spam to it.
</p>

<p>
  The email address is also used to display an avatar (see below).
</p>

<h2 id="avatars">Avatars</h2>

<p>
  The discussion board will display avatars associated with users' e-mail addresses.
  If the e-mail address is registered with <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, the associated avatar is shown.
  Otherwise, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">Identicon</a> generated from a hash of the e-mail address is displayed as a fallback.
</p>

<p>
  To use a custom avatar on this discussion board,
    <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/signup/">register an account at Gravatar</a>,
    associate an e-mail address with an image,
    and use that e-mail address when posting to this discussion board.
  Additionally, you can create a Gravatar profile, which will be accessible by clicking on your avatar.
